## Notes

I hope to have software in the future that can automate this process (Wikipedia has been able to for several reasons, I don't see why GitHub can't implement something like this. Maybe they just haven't thought of it yet. I feel like you should be able to use the entirety of MediaWiki via GitHub Wikis, the functionality can be sideloaded. The site is updated on an hourly basis anyways, and things break from time to time, what could be the harm?
