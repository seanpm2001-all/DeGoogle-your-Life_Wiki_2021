Android 2.3 Gingerbread is the seventh version of Android, a codename of the Android mobile operating system developed by Google and released in December 2010, for versions that are no longer supported. Starting on the 27th of September 2021, Google will no longer allow sign-in on Android devices that run Android 2.3.7 Gingerbread or lower. Now requiring Android 3.0 (on tablets) or 4.0 (phone and tablets) to login The Gingerbread release introduced support for near field communication (NFC)—used in mobile payment solutions—and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)—used in VoIP internet telephones.

Gingerbread's user interface was refined in many ways, making it easier to master, faster to use, and more power-efficient. A simplified color scheme with a black background gave vividness and contrast to the notification bar, menus, and other user interface components. Improvements in menus and settings resulted in easier navigation and system control.

The Nexus S smartphone, released in December 2010, was the first phone from the Google Nexus line that ran Gingerbread, and also the first one from the line with built-in NFC functionality.

## Alternatives

Android 2.3 shouldn't be in use on a mobile phone anymore. If you still want to use Android 2.3, it is recommended to do it in a virtual machine. Try using Android x86 with an Android 2.3 disk image, and enjoy the operating system.
