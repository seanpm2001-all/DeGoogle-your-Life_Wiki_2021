_An Asus Chromebit plugged into a TV._

The Chromebit is a stick PC running Google's Chrome OS operating system. When placed in the HDMI port of a television or a monitor, this device turns that display into a personal computer, the keyboard and mouse can be connected over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The device was announced in April 2015 and began shipping that November.

## Functionality

A Chromebit turns a display with an HDMI port into a desktop variant of the Chromebook laptop, which runs Google's Chrome OS operating system.

Chromebits have a superficial resemblance to the Chromecast, another Google device. But whereas the Chromecast is designed to display video and still images on a television or other large-screen display, the Chromebit is a self-contained personal computer. The device competes against the Intel Compute Stick, which offers similar plug-in functionality using two other operating systems, Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu.

## Technology

Internally, the first Chromebit resembles a standard Chromebook laptop. The device features 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0, as well as a USB 2.0 port at one end. The other end swivels, enabling it to fit into a variety of HDMI slots.

## Availability and models

Google announced the Chromebit on March 31, 2015. Google and Asus began shipping the first model that November. The Chromebit no longer received updates after November 2020.

## Alternatives

Any device that can natively run an operating system can normally connect it to a monitor in this fashion (note: a TV is considered a monitor) some other similar devices include:

Intel ComputeStick - A similar portable computer by Intel that has similar specs, and can run various Linux distributions.
