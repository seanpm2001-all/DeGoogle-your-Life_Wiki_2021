_Example of the Chrome dinosaur game_

This article is about the classic Google Chrome dinosaur game. There may be a newer version so I am told. It will be a separate article.

The Google Chrome dinosaur is an icon that appears on Chrome when no Internet connection is detected.

Upon pressing space, this error screen will turn into a running platformer game, where you try to survive as long as possible and get points. The game is automatically turned off once the Internet connection comes back. When you reach 600 points, the game transitions from day to night. At first, you only jump over cacti. As you get further into the game, you have to start avoiding birds.

On YouTube, a common trend started in 2020 where thousands of live streams were created, where every metric increase (+1 like, +1 subscriber) increased the length of the Chrome dinosaur gameplay by 1 minute to 1 hour.

An administrator of a computer can also disable the Easter Egg. It can be very distracting for schools, but it is generally frowned upon to disable it.
