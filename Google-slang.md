# Google slang

This is a list article that goes over slang terms used by Google and its users and critics, both positively and negatively.

`Googler` - Someone who performs Google searches

`Google` - As in the annoying phrase that entered common usage: "just Google it"

`Googling` - Someone who is actively performing a Google search/set of Google searches

`Scroogled` - A term used by Microsoft in their campaign against Google, a portmanteau of `Screwed` and `Google`

`FLoCed` - A term used if someone is being targetted by Googles malicious FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts) project

`YouTuber` - Someone who uploads/posts content on YouTube as a career or as a hobby, most commonly for someone who does it for ad revenue

`Adpocalypse` - A term used for the ad pullout from Google in 2015-2016 and onward when a few companies (notably: PepsiCo) pulled their advertisements due to them being displayed on hateful content, causing a snowball effect that made many major advertisers stop using YouTube, and escalated into a conflict in the YouTube community in regards to content monetization where a lot of users were punished, and a lot of restrictions were added in the money making process of creating YouTube content.

`Elsagate` - A term used to refer to the ongoing scandal on YouTube that started in 2014, where traumatizing content is being viewed by infant/young children users of YouTube, exposed to cartoon characters doing highly inappropriate things, such as injection, physical abuse, sexual assault, and more. Thousands of channels produce content like this and earn millions of dollars. The Disney character Elsa from the movie Frozen is most prominent due to the common trope of Spiderman and Elsa videos, where the 2 characters did horrific things to each other. YouTube tried responding when they started getting sued for it, but it didn't help too much. The issue is ongoing as of 2021 October 5th.
