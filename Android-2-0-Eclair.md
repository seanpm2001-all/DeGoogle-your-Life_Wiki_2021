Android Eclair is a codename of the Android mobile operating system developed by Google, the fifth operating system for Android and the second major release of Android, and for the no-longer supported versions 2.0 to 2.1. Unveiled on October 26, 2009, Android 2.1 builds upon the significant changes made in Android 1.6 "Donut".

## Features

### User experience

The default home screen of Eclair displays a persistent Google Search bar across the top of the screen. The camera app was also redesigned with numerous new camera features, including flash support, digital zoom, scene mode, white balance, color effect and macro focus. The photo gallery app also contains basic photo editing tools. This version also included the addition of live wallpapers, allowing the animation of home-screen background images to show movement. Speech-to-text was first introduced, replacing the comma key.

### Platform

Android Eclair inherits platform additions from the Donut release, including the ability to search all saved SMS and MMS messages, improved Google Maps 3.1.2, and Exchange support for the Email app. The operating system also provides improved typing speed on virtual keyboard, along with new accessibility, calendar, and virtual private network APIs. For internet browsing, Android Eclair also adds support for HTML5, refreshed browser UI with bookmark thumbnails and double-tap zoom.

## Alternatives

Android 2.0 shouldn't be in use on a mobile phone anymore. If you still want to use Android 2.0, it is recommended to do it in a virtual machine. Try using Android x86 with an Android 2.0 disk image, and enjoy the operating system.
